1. Have added the functionalty of nested/infinite flow
2. The side bar is responsive and will adjust on different screen sizes accordingly
3. Have used library to generate unique id, because when the ingredients list another set of meals there are chances that meal gets repeated and so does the id, that's why I have generated unique id where necessary
4. The color categorization of tags in sidebar has been designed solely by me on my understanding, as api does not provide list of all tags available.
5. When use wants to see tags and expand tag node there are certain cases where tags are not provided in api, here I have added a notify message
